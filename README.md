# KMP-Algorithm-for-Pattern-Searching

## Introduction

Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results.

## Time Complexity of The Algorithm

Time complexity of Naive approach is O(m(n-m+1)) where n,m are length of given string and length of pattern string whereas KMP algorithm solves this problem in O(n).

## Programming Language Used

It is implemented in C++.

## Examples

Input:  
string =  "AABAACAADAABAABA"                                                                                              
        pat = "AABA"
				
Output: Pattern found at index 0

  Pattern found at index 9
				
  Pattern found at index 12
